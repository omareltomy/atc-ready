# Traffic Information Exercise Generator - Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the logical improvements made to the aviation traffic information exercise generator to ensure realistic scenarios and accurate solutions.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. VFR Altitude Logic
**Problem**: VFR aircraft were using arbitrary 500-foot increments without following aviation rules.

**Solution**: Implemented proper hemispheric rules:
- VFR aircraft now use altitudes ending in +500 feet (e.g., 1500, 2500, 3500)
- Altitudes are constrained to realistic VFR operating ranges (500-17,500 feet)
- Follows actual aviation regulations for VFR flight levels

### 2. IFR Altitude Logic
**Problem**: IFR altitudes didn't distinguish between low and high altitude operations.

**Solution**: Implemented proper flight level rules:
- Below FL180 (18,000 feet): Use thousands (following hemispheric rules)
- Above FL180: Use flight levels in hundreds
- More realistic altitude assignments for commercial and military aircraft

### 3. Intruder Aircraft Type Selection
**Problem**: Military aircraft were only VFR, and intruder type was always tied to target type.

**Solution**: 
- Military aircraft can now be both VFR and IFR (more realistic)
- Independent selection of intruder aircraft type for more variety
- Increased military aircraft probability to 15% for more diverse scenarios

### 4. Intruder Heading Logic
**Problem**: Intruder heading was always nearly aligned with the bearing from target, creating unrealistic traffic patterns.

**Solution**: 
- Intruder heading now varies by ±90 degrees from the bearing
- Creates realistic crossing, converging, and diverging traffic patterns
- More challenging and realistic scenarios for training

### 5. Altitude Separation Logic
**Problem**: Fixed altitude differences didn't account for realistic separation requirements.

**Solution**: 
- Minimum separation based on flight rules (500ft VFR-VFR, 1000ft IFR)
- Variable separation ranges for more realistic scenarios
- Altitude validation to ensure aircraft stay within operational limits

### 6. Level Change Logic
**Problem**: Level change direction calculation was incorrect and unrealistic.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed direction calculation logic
- Level changes now create realistic approach/departure scenarios
- Changes are between 1000-3000 feet (realistic for ATC operations)
- Only applies to IFR aircraft (VFR don't typically receive level changes)

### 7. Direction Classification
**Problem**: Direction thresholds were too narrow, causing misclassification.

**Solution**: 
- Expanded thresholds for better classification:
  - Same direction: ±45 degrees
  - Opposite direction: 135-225 degrees
  - Crossing left/right: adjusted ranges
- Added vector analysis for future convergence detection

### 8. "Same Level" Threshold
**Problem**: 50-foot threshold was too tight for realistic scenarios.

**Solution**: 
- Increased to 200 feet for more realistic "same level" reporting
- Aligns with practical ATC separation standards

### 9. Solution String Accuracy
**Problem**: Solution strings sometimes contained incorrect information.

**Solution**: 
- Verified all components match actual scenario data
- Proper heavy aircraft designation
- Accurate altitude difference reporting
- Consistent distance and bearing information

## Usage
The improved generator maintains the same API but produces significantly more realistic and educationally valuable traffic scenarios for aviation training.

```typescript
import { generateExercise } from './lib/generator';

const exercise = generateExercise();
// Now generates realistic scenarios following aviation rules
```

## Validation
Run the test suite to verify all improvements:
```bash
npm run test
# or
npx tsx __tests__/validation.ts
```
