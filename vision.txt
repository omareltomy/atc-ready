Vision for the Finished ATCReady Training Module
1. Overall Concept
The app is a mobile-style, single-screen training tool for ATC trainees to practice giving traffic information. It should feel smooth, app-like (no scrolling), with fast, repeatable exercises that simulate radar scenarios.

2. User Flow
Start screen
Shows logo, short explanation, and a "Start First Exercise" button
Exercise screen
A radar screen with a generated scenario (target + intruder)
Below the radar: a button to “Show Answer” and “Next Scenario”
Clicking “Show Answer” replaces this button with the actual answer and replaces the “next scenario” button with 4 self-assessment buttons: Correct, Almost, Hard, Again
Clicking “Again” restarts the same exercise (essentially hides the answer)
After clicking the other 3 options, a new scenario is generated
End screen (after 10 exercises)
Displays score, performance breakdown, and option to restart

3. Design
Minimalist, mobile-first layout
Responsive in portrait mode, with a future landscape layout planned
No scrolling — everything must fit within 100vh
Clean UI with clearly separated sections (logo, radar, buttons)

4. Radar Screen
A centered SVG radar with 3 rings (5, 10, 15 NM)
Aircraft A always in the center (square + label)
Aircraft B placed dynamically based on clock position and distance

5. Scenario Logic
Each scenario includes:
Aircraft A (target) and B (intruder) properties
Situation parameters: clock, distance, direction, level difference, etc.

6. Scoring
After each exercise, user selects one of 4 buttons
Scoring system:
Correct = 3 pts
Almost = 2 pts
Hard = 1 pt
Again = 0 pts
After 10 scenarios, score and summary are shown
A button “Start Over” appears, when clicked goes back to a new set of 10 exercises
