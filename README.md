## 🧠 How It Works

### 1️⃣ **Scenario Generation Engine**

The heart of ATC Ready is its sophisticated scenario generation system:

**Physics-Based Modeling**
```typescript
// Simplified version of the core algorithm
function generateTrafficScenario() {
  // 1. Select aircraft types based on realistic distributions
  const targetAircraft = selectAircraft('target');
  const intruderAircraft = selectAircraft('intruder');
  
  // 2. Generate flight paths that will intersect
  const targetPath = generateFlightPath(targetAircraft);
  const intruderPath = generateIntersectingPath(targetPath);
  
  // 3. Calculate timing for conflict within radar range
  const conflictTime = calculateOptimalConflictTiming();
  
  // 4. Generate realistic performance parameters
  const scenario = buildCompleteScenario({
    target: targetAircraft,
    intruder: intruderAircraft,
    conflictTime,
    radarRange: '10 miles'
  });
  
  return scenario;
}
```

**Traffic Pattern Intelligence**
- Analyzes intersection angles to classify traffic patterns correctly
- Ensures bearing calculations match real-world ATC procedures
- Validates that all generated scenarios follow aviation standards

### 2️⃣ **Real-Time Radar Simulation**

**Dynamic Aircraft Movement**
- Aircraft move along calculated flight paths in real-time
- Positions update smoothly using React state management
- Realistic speed and altitude changes
- Accurate bearing and distance calculations from user perspective

**Interactive Elements**
- Click aircraft for detailed information
- Hover for quick callsign reference
- Zoom controls for different perspectives
- Range ring adjustments for various training scenarios

### 3️⃣ **Assessment & Learning System**

**Self-Directed Learning Approach**
The platform uses a proven educational methodology where learners:
1. **Observe** the radar scenario and traffic situation
2. **Analyze** the relationship between aircraft
3. **Formulate** appropriate traffic advisory
4. **Self-assess** their response quality
5. **Learn** from immediate feedback and explanations

**Adaptive Difficulty**
- Tracks user performance over time
- Increases scenario complexity as skills improve
- Introduces edge cases and challenging situations progressively
- Maintains engagement through balanced difficulty curves

  gamePhase: GamePhase;
  
  // Training session data
  session: {
    currentExercise: number;
    totalExercises: number;
    scores: Array<Score>;
    totalScore: number;
    startTime: Date;
  };
  
  // UI state
  showAnswer: boolean;
  showDetails: boolean;
  
  // User preferences
  settings: {
    totalExercises: number;
    saveProgress: boolean;
  };
}
```

**Action-Based Updates**
- All state changes flow through a reducer pattern

**Storage Implementation**
```typescript
// Robust storage with error handling
function saveToStorage<T>(key: string, value: T): boolean {
  try {
    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    // Graceful degradation for storage-limited environments
    console.warn('Storage unavailable:', error);
    return false;
  }
}
```
