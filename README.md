## 📋 Traffic Pattern Definitions

| Pattern | Intersection Angle | Description |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Crossing Left to Right** | 45°-135° left | Traffic crosses from left to right |
| **Crossing Right to Left** | 45°-135° right | Traffic crosses from right to left |
| **Converging** | < 45° | Head-on or nearly head-on traffic |
| **Opposite Direction** | > 315° | Aircraft on opposite headings |
| **Overtaking** | Same direction | Faster aircraft in same direction |
